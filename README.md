# **Heart Disease Prediction - End-to-End MLOps Project**  

## ** Project Description**
This project builds and deploys a **Heart Disease Prediction API** using **Machine Learning (ML) and MLOps**. The goal is to demonstrate **end-to-end ML production skills** by implementing:

- **Data Preprocessing & Model Training**: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
- **Experiment Tracking & Model Logging**: MLflow to track model performance.
- **Containerization & Deployment**: Dockerized API deployed on AWS EC2.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment using GitHub Actions.

This project ensures that every change is **automatically built, tested, and deployed** to AWS EC2 via **CI/CD**.

## **📌 Features & MLOps Workflow**
**End-to-End ML Pipeline**: Data processing → Model Training → Deployment  
**Model Tracking with MLflow** (Track Accuracy, AUC, Hyperparameters)  
**Containerized API with Docker** (Runs on Any System)  
**CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions** (Auto Deploys on Push)  
**Deployed on AWS EC2** (Live API Ready)

## **How to Use the API**

### **1️. Test API Locally**
If running locally, use the following cURL command:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5001/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"features": [63, 1, 3, 145, 233, 1, 0, 150, 0, 2.3, 0, 0, 1]}'
```

### **2. Test API on AWS EC2**
The API is publicly available at **http://44.210.111.71:5001**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://44.210.111.71:5001/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"features": [63, 1, 3, 145, 233, 1, 0, 150, 0, 2.3, 0, 0, 1]}'
```

---

## ** Deployment Details**
- **Docker Hub**: The API is available as a Docker image at: 
  - `docker pull fengdizhao/heart-disease-api:latest`
- **AWS EC2**: The API is running on a public EC2 instance (`44.210.111.71`)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automates deployment on every push to `main`.

---

## ** Model Performance**
**Neural Network performed best with:**
- **Accuracy: 0.88**
- **AUC: 0.88**

---

## ** Next Steps & Future Improvements**
**Planned Enhancements:**
- Automate **model retraining** when new data arrives.
- Implement **authentication & API security**.
- Integrate **real-time monitoring** with Prometheus/Grafana.

---

## **Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates **end-to-end MLOps practices** by:
**Building & Training ML Models**  
**Tracking Model Performance with MLflow**  
**Deploying an API on AWS EC2**  
**Automating CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
